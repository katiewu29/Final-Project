          <header><h3>How It All Started</h3></header>
          <p> Katie and Ryan, while traveling through the Amazon with “Sammy the Sloth”, came upon a coffee bean unlike any other. With a divine taste, powerful aroma, and deep vanilla note, the coffee bean was transformative for the three of them. Immediately, they ran home with the beans and began to experiment coffee recipes. After trials and tribulations, the team had found their secret sauce and began to sell their product. Many individuals found such joy in drinking their coffee that they competed it to Starbucks, the legendary coffee company. In an effort to pay homage to the worldwide impact of Starbucks and to ensure their brand made wave in the media, Katie came up with the name: Skubrats. A backwards version of Starbucks, the name was an immediate hit and their coffee began to transcend lives. </p>

          <p> Today, Skubrats spans across 100 countries and 4 continents, and has been purchased well over 2 billion times by their loyal customers (both sloth and human). Their team has grown to well over 45,000 baristas and employees. Katie and Ryan have moved to the Bahamas, where they are currently seeking their next great product. </p>

          <header><h3>What's To Come</h3></header>
          <p> In the future, Skubrats hopes to expand into other popular beverage industries, particularly soda and milk as they think there is great opportunity to break their coffee beans down into core ingredients that improve the taste of any and all beverages. If you’d like to keep hearing updates about the Skubrats journey, feel free to come have a drink and speak with the team at one of our 14,000 coffee shops around the world!</p>
